# After-Vaccination-App

Inspiration- 🙈🙈

After a long wait vaccines🧪 are here to fight against the covid-19.
But those all vaccines are not in the mass vaccination program,
these vaccines are in test👩‍⚕️ phase in which a vaccine is used to vaccinate a
certain group of people for specific amount of time & as a result we get the
data from those to understand that how is our vaccine working.
Problem- That data is not accurate & precise Ttherefoer to solve this problem we created "After Vaccination" app.

What it does-🧐🧐

Once a use vaccinated by any type of vaccine 🤝
available in the market then he/she can store
the data of how his/her body responds on the daily 
basis after being vaccinated and further that user can easily
show the complete accurate and precise report to doctor and by
that doctor will easily understand that how that kind of vaccine 
is working on that kind of person, so you can understand by this we can find numerous amount of data.
